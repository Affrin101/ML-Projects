Project 1:

Review Scrapper (Scrapping Review of mobile phone from an e-commerce website)
Web scraping is a technique using which the webpages from the internet are fetched and parsed to understand and extract specific information similar to a human being.In this project, we try to scrap the reviews from the website about the phone that we are planning to buy. Our end goal is to build a web scraper that collects the reviews of a product from the internet.
Prerequisites:
The things needed before we start building a python based web scraper are:
• Python
• A Python IDE : like PyCharm, Spyder, or any other IDE of choice 
• Flask (command: pip install flask)
• MongoDB 
• Basic understanding of Python and HTML.
• Basic understanding of Git (download Git CLI from https://gitforwindows.org/)

Explanation :

The two more folders called ‘static’ and ‘templates’ hold the code for the UI of our application. The ‘static’ folder contains ‘css’
for keeping the stylesheets for our UI.
Inside the folder ‘templates’, there are three HTML files called: ‘base.html’,’index.html’, and ‘results.html’.
• base.html→ It acts as the common building block for the other two HTML
pages.
• index.html→ Home page of our application.
• results.html→ Page to show the reviews for the searched keyword.
